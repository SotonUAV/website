				<h2>Airstart</h2>

				<article class="long">
					<p>
						Airstart is a collaborative Research and Development project developing key technologies to support routine small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, UAV, operations Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS). Conceived in 2014, the project commenced in November 2015, grant aided by the Aerospace Technology Institute, ATI.
					</p>

					<p>
						Commercial small UAVs are becoming ubiquitous in our society, in applications from film-making to surveying. However, one issue is seriously limiting their widescale use – the ability to safely and routinely operate and gather information outside of line of sight of the operator. Key activities of significant benefit to society, such as search and rescue, or power utility asset inspection, will only be realised if UAVs can safely operate over longer distances.
					</p>

					<p>
						By February 2018, with these end-users forming an integral part of the Consortium, AIRSTART seeks to provide a technology basis to achieve both increased societal benefits and economic impact from small UAVs.

				<article class="long">
					<p>
						The OPSARS (Oceanography and Polar Science through Agile Robotic Systems) Project is a study to determine the feasibility of using a UAV to deploy a small AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle). This enables the AUV to be delivered to precise locations that are prohibitively remote or inaccessible to be reached by research vessels, including cracks in ice sheets.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The potential speed of deployment also makes the system well suited to investigation of oil spills, effects of natural disasters, and other applications where rapid response is paramount. Opportunity for synergy between the UAV and AUV increases the potential capability of the system.
					</p>

					<p>
						In November 2016 a trial payload release test was carried out over land using a dummy submarine to ensure the AUV release mechanism was functioning correctly. This trial can be seen in the video below.

				<h2>Project Albatross</h2>

				<img class="long" alt="Project Albatross" src="../images/antarctica-cropped.jpg">

				<article class="long">
					<p>
						Following the success of Project Triangle, the Royal Navy were keen to further explore the capabilities of Sulsa by embarking on a far more ambitious set of flight trials. Project Albatross saw Sulsa travel to the Southern Ocean on board the Royal Navy’s icebreaker, HMS Protector, with the aim of providing the ship with information on surrounding sea ice and assessing the system’s performance in harsh Antarctic conditions.
					</p>

					<p>
						A total of four flights were conducted, two of which were EVLOS (extended visual line of sight), with Sulsa capturing useful footage that contributed to HMS Protector’s situational awareness. The trials showed that Sulsa’s performance was not significantly affected by the freezing temperatures, and that it was able to withstand ditching in the sea after each flight. However, live video feed and ability to recover to the ship were identified as capabilities that would improve the utility of the aircraft. 
					</p>

					<p>
						A short video was created showing footage from this project and can be viewed below. The on-board video was captured using an action camera intergrated in the nose of the airframe. This allowed high definition video of the flights to be recorded.

				<h2>Project Triangle</h2>

				<img class="long" alt="Project Triangle" src="../images/chesil.jpg">

				<article class="long">
					<p>
						Project Triangle arose from the Royal Navy's need for a low cost reconnaissance platform that could be easily operated from existing vessels. They also envisage that future ships might be equipped with 3D printers, allowing parts to be manufactured on board and thereby reducing reliance on supply chains. As a result there was particular interest in the University of Southampton's Sulsa UAV, which was the world's first 3D printed aircraft when it first flew in 2011.
					</p>

					<p>
						A concept capability demonstration was planned to showcase the aircraft's capabilities and test the feasibility of operating it at sea, and on 20th July 2015 Sulsa performed a flight from the River Class patrol vessel, HMS Mersey. Sulsa, which had been modified to include a high definition camera, was launched from the flight deck and performed a successful two and a half minute automatic flight before landing on the nearby Chesil beach. The test was a success, and clearly demonstrated the potential utility of low-cost ship launched UAVs.

				<h2>BERISUAS</h2>

				<article class="long">
					<p>
						In emergencies at sea accurate information is of great importance. With good information at the right time it is possible to make better decisions. Observations from the above give a good view of a calamity. After which further assistance can be offered. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs popular said Drones, can ensure this. To investigate the potential the BERISUAS project was started. The acronym BERISUAS stands for: 'Better Response and Improved Safety through Unmanned Aircraft Systems.
					</p>

					<p>
						A thematic research project where seven project partners work together under the Interreg IVA 2 Seas Programme. This brings together two Interreg projects (MIRG EU and 3i) to align their activities and build on their results together.
					</p>

					<p>
						MIRG EU stands for Maritime Incident Response Group. Its main task is to restrain maritime incidents and emergencies at sea. During the 3i project a prototype UAV and mobile ground station was developed. This hardware will be used in the demonstration of the possible assistance using a UAV in combination with MIRG activity’s.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the first project phase of BERISUAS the benefits of using a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) during a maritime incident were identified. This is the case in many work situations. Not only in the maritime arena but in every environment. During accidents and on regular basis for governments, company’s and civilians. When the UAV system is used for multiple purposes the cost per flight will drop dramatically, to only a fraction of the normal price when using conventional techniques. To address a broader perspective the BERISUAS project we will also address other possibilities for using Unmanned Arial Systems (UAS) besides MIRG teams.

				<article class="long">
					<p>
						The 3i project aimed to improve maritime safety in the cross-border area (English Channel and southern North Sea) by using new technologies, implementing remotely piloted aircraft or autonomous systems. Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles will allow the creation of a new, cost effective and reliable monitoring service, for maritime safety organizations that border the English Channel and southern North Sea.
					</p>

					<p>
						The 3i project gathered a consortium of scientific and specialist organizations (Further and Higher Education institutes, SMEs and economic development agencies) and Public Sector bodies (Police, harbour agencies, firefighting and emergency departments). The partners have worked together in research and development activities, to build a joint prototype UAV and performing joint testing and demonstrations. 
					</p>

					<p>
						This cross-border project improved the knowledge on unmanned aircraft for maritime security applications and helped to develop new technology and business opportunities for the 2 Seas area.
